Family Movie: Trolls. Animated. A colourful, wondrous world populated by hilariously unforgettable characters is upended when the overly optimistic Trolls, with a constant song on their lips, are taken from their village by the Bergens. Poppy, the happiest Troll ever, and her cranky friend Branch come to their rescue. (2016, PG, 92 mins.)
