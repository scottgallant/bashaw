<p>A colleague of mine was on Facebook the other day looking for a song to sing in his church on Sunday morning.&nbsp; He was looking for “They’ll know we are Christians by our love.”&nbsp; Now the darn thing’s stuck in my head and I can’t get rid of it.</p>
<p>Thankfully.</p>
<p>I’m not saying it’s the greatest tune ever; how many ear worms are, really?&nbsp; But it’s the message.</p>
<p>Back in 1966, Peter Scholtes was a Roman catholic priest in a parish on the south side of Chicago.&nbsp; He was leading a youth choir, so the story goes, and looking for a good song about unity and love that they could sing at some ecumenical, interracial events.&nbsp; When he didn’t find what he was looking for, he wrote this one.&nbsp; The song’s in a few hymn books still, but most people who remember it know it as a folk classic they probably learned at youth group or camp.</p>
<p>The verses are about how we are one in the Spirit and we walk hand in hand and work side by side together.&nbsp; The refrain each time is “and they’ll know we are Christians by our love, by our love, and they’ll know we are Christians by our love.”&nbsp; Scholtes is affirming the powerful words of Jesus from John 13, verses 34 and 35:&nbsp; “I give you a new commandment, that you love one another.&nbsp; Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another.&nbsp; By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”&nbsp; I like these words.&nbsp; I use them a lot.&nbsp; And that can be a bit of a problem.</p>
<p>On a sunny spring Sunday in April, sitting on the most comfortably padded pews in town, surrounded by friends in a brightly lit church with the smell of a delicious potluck lunch waiting to be enjoyed, these words can sound like some real warm fuzzies.&nbsp; A blissful paradise of community in which everyone gets along, everyone shares, everyone, well, loves.</p>
<p>But Jesus says these words to the disciples on their last night together before his arrest.&nbsp; This little piece of the story begins back at John 13:1 with “Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart from this world and go to the Father.&nbsp; Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.”&nbsp; It includes supper with the disciples, a diverse group that probably didn’t always get along and who, now at least, seem pretty confused and upset about what’s happening.&nbsp; It includes dinner with Judas, his betrayer, and Peter, the one who promises to follow, but who will deny him.&nbsp; As night falls, the threat of arrest looms and the violence of the cross is coming.</p>
<p>That’s the context of Jesus words.&nbsp; And they were not words of comfort and reassurance, but a call to action, a challenge to live “just as I have loved you.”&nbsp; The command to love wasn’t new, those words had been round for awhile.&nbsp; What made it new was the example of living it: Jesus didn’t love when convenient, nor was he selective about who should be loved or how they should be loved.&nbsp; He didn’t judge love-worthiness but loved all, especially the broken, the sick, the outcasts and the enemies.&nbsp; In Jesus, love becomes the all encompassing manner in which we engage the world to create positive, living, life-giving relationships.&nbsp; Right now.</p>
<p>When Peter Scholtes wrote his song, it was the middle of the 1960s, the era of the Civil Rights Movement, foreign conflicts, changing social systems - and what’s generally regarded as the beginning of the decline in church attendance.&nbsp; I doubt he meant anything less than the practical, all encompassing love that Jesus lived.</p>
<p>It sounds great to say “love one another” but let’s just acknowledge right here that it’s hard.&nbsp; We fail often, sometimes spectacularly.&nbsp; History is full of evidence to suggest that, often as not, people should know that we are Christians by our hypocrisy, our insularity, our selfishness, our judging of others and our own sense of self-righteousness.&nbsp; But that’s not who we are if we are followers of Jesus.&nbsp; What would it take to change that perception, that people might know we are Christians by our humanity, our humble recognition of mistakes that have been made, our repentance - real repentance - for less-than-loving behaviour and our grace and hope?&nbsp; It would take love.</p>
<p>Yes, it would take love when it is easiest, with people who look, sound, think and believe like us, when there’s no temptation to be selfish or vengeful or see anything but equality or when our love is welcomed and love is returned.&nbsp; And it would take love when it is hardest, when we’re afraid of difference and change, when we’re tempted to be selfish and unforgiving, when it’s easier to withhold ourselves and refuse to engage others.&nbsp; It would take love in moments when hate is easier, separation is more appealing and aggression and power seems to make us feel strong.&nbsp; It would take love when we’re most vulnerable and when we’re feeling most powerful.</p>
<p>It would take love.</p>
