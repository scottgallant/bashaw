<p>How do you know it's Jesus?</p>
<p>Well, Advent’s coming and that marks not only the imminent arrival of Christmas, but the beginning of the church year.&nbsp; Unlike the secular calendar, the church year doesn’t begin on January 1, it begins with the first Sunday of Advent (November 29, this year).</p>
<p>Did I say “begin” often enough?</p>
<p>This week’s gospel passage, Mark 13:1-8, is often referred to as the Little Apocalypse.&nbsp; In it, the disciples are awed by the size and grandeur of the Temple in Jerusalem, but Jesus tells them that it will all be destroyed.&nbsp; They ask him when and how they’ll know it’s about to happen.&nbsp; Jesus doesn’t say, but he does tell them that much more will happen, wars and earthquakes and famines, but the end is still to come.&nbsp; “This is but the beginning of the birth pangs” (Mark 13:8).</p>
<p>So, the beginning is near.</p>
<p>Just because I don’t really think that this is the most interesting part of this passage, can I address what I think are a couple of little issues here?</p>
<p>I know we’ve come to understand that an apocalypse is the violent destruction of everything, but that’s not really what it means.&nbsp; “Apocalypse” means a revealing or disclosing of information.&nbsp; Hence the Book of Revelation.&nbsp; Or Jesus revealing this important information right here: this will end, but it is the beginning of something new.&nbsp; A birth.&nbsp; Is it really about the ending or the beginning?&nbsp; The exact details aren’t revealed, but that’s what makes something Jesus says in the middle of all this so perplexing.</p>
<p>“Beware that no one leads you astray.&nbsp; Many will come in my name and say, ‘I am he!’ and they will lead many astray” (Mark 13:5-6).</p>
<p>How do we know, then?&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m not trying to be stupid about this and it’s not a trick question: how would you know it’s Jesus?&nbsp; Or not?</p>
<p>It’s a classic question.&nbsp; Someone walks into your church on a Sunday morning, heads straight up the centre aisle to the pulpit and says “I’m Jesus, I have returned.”&nbsp; How do you know it’s Jesus or not?</p>
<p>I don’t have an answer for that (see 3 below).&nbsp; But here’s a few things to think about, in no particular order.</p>
<p>1. I’m not sure that Jesus would appear in my church on a Sunday morning.&nbsp; Not because there aren’t wonderful, kind and loving followers of Jesus in the pews there, but rather because there is.&nbsp; Jesus will always be found first with those most in need, the poor, sick and lonely.</p>
<p>2. I wonder how Jesus will handle “the church.”&nbsp; Jesus constantly questioned institutions and structures.&nbsp; That’s not to say that Jesus would avoid churches, I just think Jesus is about people first.</p>
<p>3. If the Jesus you meet has an answer for every question you have and tells you what you should think, I think that I’d think twice about that Jesus.&nbsp; I think Jesus wants to guide us on our journey in life, not tell us how to walk and where to walk.&nbsp; We find our way with Jesus by our side.</p>
<p>4. Speaking of life, anyone who tells you that they need to bring about the end times now, in any way that causes hurt, pain or damage to others or any part of creation, is not Jesus.&nbsp; The end will come when it comes, we need to watch for it, not accelerate it.&nbsp; And remember, the end of this world is the birth of a new one.</p>
<p>5. The good news of Jesus belongs to no particular nation, culture, tradition, society or people named Jesus.&nbsp; It’s about life, love and grace for all.&nbsp; All.</p>
<p>6. I don’t think Jesus demands blind obedience, but a thoughtful, heartfelt partnership.&nbsp; “Blind faith” ought to be an oxymoron.&nbsp; True faith should demand our thoughtful minds, caring hearts and eager hands.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Jesus is about building community, with respect, justice and equality for all, whoever and however we are.&nbsp; I don’t think Jesus is interested in sameness or uniformity, but rather a unity or oneness that comes from recognizing the uniqueness of each of us and how we come together.</p>
<p>8. That means relationships are important.&nbsp; I don’t think Jesus would isolate or set apart anyone.&nbsp; I think Jesus wants to engage the world, seeking ways to include everyone.</p>
<p>9. I don’t think Jesus would ever use fear.&nbsp; One of the most important things said by the Jesus we know was “don’t be afraid,” and Jesus said it often.&nbsp;</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; Love.&nbsp; Jesus is all about love.&nbsp; If love isn’t at the heart of it, it’s not Jesus.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, you could probably just skip numbers 1-9 and just go with that last one.&nbsp; That’s how you know it’s Jesus: love.</p>
