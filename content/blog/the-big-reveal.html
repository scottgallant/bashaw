<p>Well, the season of Epiphany’s a wrap this week with the glorious story of the Transfiguration.&nbsp; That’s assuming you recognize Epiphany as a season - and not everyone does.&nbsp; But I hope you do, because epiphany means “to reveal” or “make known” and, week after week since January 6, we’ve heard gospel stories which reveal something about Jesus.&nbsp; It hasn’t been a long Epiphany this year, so I’ll do a quick recap.</p>
<p>The first story is the arrival of the magi who followed a star seeking the promised one. Next is the story of the adult Jesus being baptized by John in the Jordan River.&nbsp; “The Holy Spirit descended upon him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven, ‘You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased’” (Luke 3:22).&nbsp; This is followed by the miracle-worker Jesus turning water to wine at a wedding in Cana.&nbsp; Then Jesus reads scripture from Isaiah in his home synagogue, proclaiming it fulfilled in him.&nbsp; Being challenged by Jesus, who they think they know, angers the crowd who drive him out of town.&nbsp; And finally, this week, Jesus goes to the mountaintop with three disciples and is transfigured there: “the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became dazzling white.”&nbsp; Moses and Elijah appear with him and again a voice says “This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!” (Luke 9:29, 35).</p>
<p>That’s a lot of important information about Jesus: Jesus is the promised one, the Messiah;&nbsp; Jesus is God’s beloved; Jesus is a miracle worker; the “Spirit of the Lord” is with Jesus to accomplish all Isaiah promised; Jesus is more than the “Joseph’s son” they think they know; Jesus is God’s chosen, the one to whom we should listen.</p>
<p>Jesus is.&nbsp; Yes, that’s a lot of revealing.&nbsp; But if you stopped at “Jesus is,” then I think you missed the most important point of Epiphany.&nbsp; It’s not just how Jesus is revealed to us, but how Jesus is revealed in us.</p>
<p>Let me recap again, a little differently.&nbsp; Let me tell you some of what I think’s really being revealed here.</p>
<p>Jesus is revealed to the magi as the promised one.&nbsp; That’s magi who were not Jews, nor were they from Judea.&nbsp; They were mysterious visitors we don’t know anything about from somewhere “east,” we’re not sure where, exactly.&nbsp; We just know they’re different.&nbsp; That reveals to me that Jesus is for everyone.&nbsp; That’s everyone.&nbsp; And we should be, too.</p>
<p>Jesus is God’s beloved.&nbsp; You know who else is beloved by God?&nbsp; You.&nbsp; And me and everyone.&nbsp; Jesus wanted to be baptized by John, just like everyone else, before he began living that ministry that teaches us how to live, loving others as we are loved.&nbsp; Maybe that reveals that we, too, should recognize that we’re loved and love others as we are loved.</p>
<p>Jesus is a miracle-worker.&nbsp; Sure, but is that really the point of the story?&nbsp; Or is it that Jesus, in his first miracle in John’s gospel, gracefully and without drawing attention to himself, brings joy in a moment that could have gone disastrously in the opposite direction.&nbsp; Maybe that reveals that we could offer our gifts - our own little miracles - in an equally humble and selfless way.</p>
<p>Jesus is filled with the Spirit and moved by the Spirit.&nbsp; The scripture he is proclaiming fulfilled is that he will&nbsp; bring good news to the poor, proclaim release to the captives, give sight to the blind and freedom to the oppressed.&nbsp; Isn’t that what Jesus calls us all to do?&nbsp; Sure it is.&nbsp; And when we preach it, it sounds good and gives everyone a warm feeling.&nbsp; But when Jesus challenges his own home crowd that they aren’t doing it, that isn’t what they want to hear and they’re offended and angry.&nbsp; It takes strength of Spirit to stand up to them.&nbsp; That reveals to me that we need to embrace the Spirit within us, not only to talk, but to do, to get on with a life that makes our living life-giving, too.</p>

<p>That’s a huge challenge and maybe needs some time and some thought to figure it out.&nbsp; I think that’s why Jesus went into the wilderness that we call Lent.&nbsp; Perhaps we could join him there over the next few weeks and wonder how we, too, are living into being Jesus.</p>
