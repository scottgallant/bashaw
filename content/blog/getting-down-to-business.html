<p>It might not seem right that the gospel story for the last Sunday in June should be about getting down to business.</p>
<p>The summer’s here and many people, especially children, will be looking for some holidays or at least some relaxation and enjoyment of the summer weather.&nbsp; That’s our mindset: you work, you play.&nbsp; And here’s a little story from Luke that begins “when the days drew near for him to be taken up, he set his face to go to Jerusalem” (Luke 9:51).&nbsp; I think that’s Bible-speak for “I don’t have much time left, so let’s get some work done.”</p>
<p>And, certainly, lots is going to happen.&nbsp; But first, four little vignettes will set the context for what kind of business this is - and it’s not how we understand business.</p>
<p>First, Jesus’ sends people ahead to make things ready, but the Samaritans who live in the next village aren’t really interested because he was headed to Jerusalem.&nbsp; When the disciples want to punish them, Jesus rebukes them and moves on.&nbsp; I think this isn’t about the whole Jews and Samaritans hate each other thing (see the Parable of the Good Samaritan later in Luke), but rather one of the reasons why: Samaritans believed that God should be worshipped at Mount Gerizim, not Jerusalem.&nbsp; I also think that this is Jesus saying “my business isn’t about punishment, it’s about love.&nbsp; And, besides, they come to God their way.&nbsp; That doesn’t make them bad.”</p>
<p>In the verses before “he set his face to go to Jerusalem,” we heard John complaining of someone casting out demons in Jesus’ name who wasn’t one of their group.&nbsp; Jesus tells him not to stop him because “whoever is not against you is for you.”&nbsp; Here he is again reminding his followers - and us - that doing good things isn’t about following the same rules or belonging to the same group.&nbsp; What it’s about is doing good things and loving all, that’s the business at hand.</p>
<p>They move on and meet someone on the road who claims they will follow Jesus wherever he goes.&nbsp; Jesus replies that he has no place to go to, “nowhere to lay his head.”&nbsp; Even though he knows his days are limited, I don’t think Jesus sees the cross as a destination.&nbsp; I think he wants this man - and us - to know that the journey is important, that each moment of the journey is important and we live into each moment.&nbsp; Don’t focus on the past, Jesus might say, or the future, but this moment, that’s the business at hand.</p>
<p>As they move on, Jesus calls to another to follow, but this person wants to bury their father first.&nbsp; “Let the dead bury their own dead,” says Jesus, “but as for you, go and proclaim the kingdom of God.”&nbsp; That seems unduly callous and not very loving at all, Jesus.&nbsp; And more than a little incongruous with the Jesus that was filled with compassion for the widowed mother who’d now lost her son, just a couple of chapters ago (Luke 7).&nbsp; Remember, just outside of Nain?&nbsp; Jesus restores the man to life, and thereby his mother, too.&nbsp; And then there’s raising Jairus’ daughter from death (Luke 8).&nbsp; Why would Jesus respond this way now?</p>
<p>Perhaps Jesus sees that this isn’t a moment for compassion or mourning or death and it’s not about all the complicated rules and rituals around first century Hebrew burials.&nbsp; It’s a moment for proclaiming what the kingdom of God is all about: life.&nbsp; This is the journey Jesus is on.&nbsp; Following Jesus on the journey to new life, that’s the business at hand.</p>
<p>A final vignette is a man who says he will follow, but he wants to say goodbye to his family first.&nbsp; That seems reasonable, but Jesus replies that you don’t go forward while looking back.&nbsp; I don’t think Jesus wants the man to abandon his family or his former life, nor do I think that he wants him to forget them.&nbsp; I think it’s about procrastination and hesitation and, for Jesus, the time is now.&nbsp; Remembering the past and learning from the past is one thing, but a commitment to the past is not a way forward.&nbsp; And the way is forward and Jesus is the way, that’s the business at hand.</p>
<p>Jesus is about the business of life.&nbsp; That’s a journey where every moment counts, where every moment is about living.&nbsp; It’s a life not confined by a set of rules, but open by love.&nbsp; It’s full of work and play, labour and rest, because every moment is an opportunity for good, for healing and wholeness.&nbsp; Jesus calls us to follow on this journey, that’s the business at hand.</p>
