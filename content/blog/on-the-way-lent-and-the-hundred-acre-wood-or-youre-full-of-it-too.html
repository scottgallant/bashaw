<p>A few years ago, I wrote a piece about Lent that addresses a bit of a pet peeve of mine.&nbsp; I was reminded of it this week because I’m on a sabbatical working on a creative project around stories for children and it used a particularly familiar childhood image.&nbsp; But, as I read it, it occurs to me that it might have sounded a little less than serious and a little less than respectful of traditions that have meaning for many and it needed something more.&nbsp; It is, after all though, just my opinion and it went something like this.</p>
<p>Well, it’s the season of Lent in many churches.&nbsp; Sigh.</p>
<p>Lent’s that time in the church year that’s usually characterized by the colour purple and hymns in a minor key.&nbsp; Slow hymns.&nbsp; Really, really slow hymns.&nbsp; Sigh.</p>
<p>Oh and giving up things.&nbsp; Have you given something up for Lent?&nbsp; Not a lot of people do that anymore, but it used to be a popular tradition.&nbsp; Not much anymore, though.&nbsp; Sigh.The origin of giving something up for Lent lies in the season being a penitential one, one in which fasting was commonly practiced.&nbsp; Fasting, almsgiving (giving to the sick and needy) and prayer were the cornerstones of Lent.&nbsp; These reminded us of the need to be penitent, to engage in some self-examination and repentance leading up to Holy Week and Easter.&nbsp; But before we can get there, the story of Jesus being tempted by the Devil in the wilderness leads us into Lent, a dark, dry and dreary time.&nbsp; Sigh.</p>
<p>Okay, that’s a lot of sighing.&nbsp; Some of those traditions and ways of understanding Lent have been, and still are, meaningful to many.&nbsp; But I wonder if we might not also consider that there’s another way of engaging that time of introspection, self-examination, reflection and repentance.</p>
<p>The story that frames the season of Lent for many people is this: “Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness, where for forty days he was tempted by the devil.”&nbsp; (Luke 4:1-2)&nbsp; Jesus, in the wilderness, being tempted by the devil.&nbsp; Wilderness, temptation and the devil.&nbsp; All things we fear or, at least, would rather avoid.</p>
<p>I wonder if we haven’t mis-characterized the season of Lent.&nbsp; I wonder if we haven’t made Lent the Eeyore of the church year, when it needs to be the Tigger.</p>
<p>Remember them in the Winnie the Pooh stories?&nbsp; Eeyore is the melancholy, pessimistic and fearful gray donkey.&nbsp; Tigger is the enthusiastic, energetic and curious tiger. &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jaRUWusf4-k/Vr4kpElksqI/AAAAAAAAAzs/KG2cP6XA3ag/s1600/tiggereeyore.jpg"></a>I think we need to re-engage Lent as a Tigger time.&nbsp; Yes, we should be thinking about our relationship with God, learning about living with Jesus in our lives and considering what “repentance” might mean to us.&nbsp; (It doesn’t just mean saying or being sorry for wrong, by the way, it means to take action to change as well).&nbsp; But I think we should do that with enthusiasm, with curiosity and with joy.</p>
<p>For the earliest Christians, called “the people of the Way,” Easter was the focus of the year and an important time for baptism and for people joining their faith community.&nbsp; Consequently, the weeks leading up to Easter were a time to learn about Jesus and how to live as Jesus taught, about our relationship with God and being part of this new community.&nbsp; That’s an exciting time, lived with enthusiasm by committed Christians.</p>
<p>The word “lent,” by the way, comes from an old Germanic word that means “spring.”&nbsp; You remember spring - when the days get longer, it’s warmer and stuff starts growing again - it’s a time of new life and growth.</p>
<p>But most important of all, go back and look at those verses from Luke again.&nbsp; I don’t think Jesus was afraid to go into the wilderness, he didn’t back away from engaging temptation and he didn’t fear the devil.&nbsp; Jesus, says Luke, was full of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; He wasn’t empty, reluctant, defenceless or afraid.&nbsp; Jesus went with the power of God, the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; The devil didn’t really stand a chance.</p>
<p>You, too, are full of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Look back at the season of Epiphany.&nbsp; Remember all those ways in which Jesus is “revealed,” not just to us, but in us.&nbsp; The Spirit is in you.&nbsp; Really.&nbsp; There’s a little Tigger in everyone.</p>
<p>Easter’s coming.&nbsp; Let’s take some time to examine our life, think about where God is in it, how we might be living out what Jesus taught and how we could live it better.&nbsp; Let’s take on the task of trying to grow and be better people making a better world.&nbsp; Let’s do it with enthusiasm, with sincerity and with commitment.</p>
<p>Easter’s coming.&nbsp; It’s Tigger Time.</p>
<p>That, right there was my closing line: it’s Tigger Time.&nbsp; I said it and I stand by it.</p>
<p>But it shouldn’t have been - and isn’t - the end.&nbsp; Curiosity, wonder, fearlessness, enthusiasm and faith in God’s presence bring us to, and through, the journey.&nbsp; The journey, itself, is full of questions and experiences that teach us, mold us and transform us.&nbsp; Engage them all.</p>
<p>For Lent, or any day really, these words of Henri Nouwen are a really good place to start: “Did I offer peace today?&nbsp; Did I bring a smile to someone’s face?&nbsp; Did I say words of healing?&nbsp; Did I let go of my anger and resentment?&nbsp; Did I forgive?&nbsp; Did I love?’&nbsp; These are the real questions.”</p>
