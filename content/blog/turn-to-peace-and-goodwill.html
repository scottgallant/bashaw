<p>A good opening line's important.&nbsp; This week, mine was going to be "is it just me, or is everyone a little edgy lately?"</p>
<p>That could be a good opening line, but it's not right now.&nbsp; Right now, it's trite, foolish and dismissive.&nbsp; Because the answer's "yes."</p>
<p>And it's not hard to see why.&nbsp; Look what's happening in the world: another mass shooting, terrorism, violence, climate change, the economy, unemployment, poverty, hunger.&nbsp; Perhaps, though, it's not because any of that's new, but because it's not.&nbsp; And it's become significantly closer and more personal.&nbsp; We're getting "wore down," as my wife would say, and we're showing it.</p>
<p>We're becoming overwhelmed with fear, hurt and anger.&nbsp; And we're expressing it.&nbsp; Look beyond the usual generalizations we make about media and government, and look at what people are saying and how they're saying it.&nbsp; Look at social media and the day to day conversations we're having in coffee shops and meetings, even street corners.</p>
<p>Facebook's always been a place where people will post - and believe - pretty much anything, but lately grumpy cat's been replaced with vitriolic and often personal attacks, not always based on substantiated fact.&nbsp; "Trash" or "smack" talk isn't just isolated to intimidating opponents in a competitive sport, it's made it's way into everyday use.&nbsp; And we're responding.</p>
<p>But it's not just talk.&nbsp; It's confrontation and fight.</p>
<p>Remember the movie The Untouchables, way back in 1987?&nbsp; Jim Malone is talking to Eliot Ness about Al Capone - in a church, no less - and he says, "you wanna know how to get Capone?&nbsp; They pull a knife, you pull a gun.&nbsp; He sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue.&nbsp; That's the Chicago way!&nbsp; And that's how you fight Capone.&nbsp; Now do you want to do that?&nbsp; Are you ready to do that?"</p>
<p>No.&nbsp; Say "no." &nbsp; The right answer is "no."&nbsp; That wasn't Ness's answer, but, to be fair, in the end they got Capone on tax evasion.</p>
<p>Still, it's tended to be our answer for a very long time.&nbsp; So let's just pause and take a moment to remind ourselves that we have a choice.&nbsp; That choice should be informed by love, not hate and by hope, not fear.&nbsp; Those are the things that bring peace and goodwill, things that should be on our mind at this time of year.</p>
<p>As part of our Advent, preparing the way for Jesus, we meet John the Baptizer, too.&nbsp; The gospel of Luke describes him with the words of the prophet Isaiah, as a lone voice, "crying in the wilderness" that people should prepare with repentance.&nbsp; Please don't be taken aback by that word.&nbsp; We've loaded it up with guilt and sin, required certain behaviour from it and made forgiveness conditional on it, but that's not what it's about. And God's forgiveness isn't conditional, anyway.&nbsp; But to repent simply means to turn away from behaviour that's hurtful and destructive and turn to what is true.&nbsp; John called people to turn towards the love that was coming their way in Jesus.</p>
<p>As we turn towards Christmas, take a moment and make a choice.&nbsp; In the face of all that overwhelms us, choose to hope.&nbsp; Choose to bring peace.&nbsp; Choose to love.</p>
