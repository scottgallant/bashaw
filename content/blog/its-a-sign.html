<p><br></p>
<p>We have five signs outside our church right now.&nbsp; It might seem like we got a little carried away because that’s a lot of signage, but it’s all important.&nbsp; Each has a message and a purpose.</p>
<p>It can be a little too easy, though, to get so used to them being there that one doesn’t really pay as much attention to them as one should.&nbsp; It’s good to have reminders.</p>
<p>Take our main sign, for example.&nbsp; It has the name of the church permanently on the top and then a space where you can change the letters to make different announcements, like what’s happening that week or a special event.&nbsp; Because I’m on sabbatical right now, I don’t decide what’s on it, so I look to see what it says.&nbsp; Reminds me to look at the other part, too, the part that has the congregation’s mission: living God’s love, sharing God’s love.</p>
<p>That’s the official “statement,” but the other signs say a little bit more about how we’d like to be doing that.</p>
<p>Like the rough, hand painted one I’ve talked about before that says “WE’LL TAKE ANYONE.”&nbsp; That’s a tough calling to live up to and I’ve no doubt there’s been, and will be, some challenges with that.&nbsp; But we mean it.&nbsp; For awhile we even had a smaller sign inside that said just that, “and we mean it,” just to remind everyone.</p>
<p>But every now and then there’s a little reminder to look at it again when I hear people comment that we can’t possibly mean “anyone,” because, well, what if the wrong people got in?&nbsp; You know, “those” people.</p>
<p>I’m not always sure who “those” people are (though it’s made pretty clear - and specific - sometimes), but perhaps the sign isn’t precise enough.&nbsp; Perhaps it should read “we’ll take anyone - because Jesus would.”&nbsp; Jesus didn’t just welcome “sinners” and “enemies” - prostitutes, tax collectors, Romans, Samaritans, lepers, the poor, the hurting, the angry and every kind of marginalized person - he actively sought them out.&nbsp; There’s no such thing as “those” people if you desire to live and share God’s love.</p>
<p>That’s not say it isn’t challenging.&nbsp; Or that we, or anyone else, is good at it.&nbsp; Jesus doesn’t call people to perfection, Jesus calls people to love.&nbsp; And love is messy and challenging.&nbsp; So we try.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ogedwk7DtZg/VqrmfzTc1MI/AAAAAAAAAzI/SSJR-Y4pnNU/s1600/Be%2Bthe%2Bchurch.jpg"></a>There’s a third sign, next to the front door, that we put up at the time of the Angels Among Us campaign.&nbsp; It says some of the ways we try to love.&nbsp; Some of it’s new, some of it’s borrowed, but it’s all true.&nbsp; It reads “BE THE CHURCH.&nbsp; Care for others.&nbsp; Forgive often.&nbsp; Spread Love.&nbsp; Fight for the powerless.&nbsp; Protect the earth.&nbsp; Share your blessings and talents.&nbsp; Be kind.&nbsp; Embrace diversity.&nbsp; Love God.&nbsp; Enjoy this life.”</p>
<p>Being the church isn’t about the building or Sundays at 11, it’s about these things.&nbsp; And again, no one’s claiming perfection or even success at doing them, but rather the aspiration that doing them would be living God’s love and sharing God’s love.</p>
<p>Maybe it might inspire people to “spread your wings and love.”&nbsp; That’s the phrase someone wisely added to the bottom of the temporary sign on the lawn that promoted our Angels Among Us campaign in November.&nbsp; It used to be surrounded by over one hundred stakes with “angels” and their stories on them and soon, it, too, will be put away until next year.&nbsp; But that was the goal of the campaign, to encourage people in the community to recognize those who spread their wings, living and sharing love.</p>
<p>Now, I said five signs, and if you’ve been by the church lately, you’re probably wondering where the fifth sign is.&nbsp; It’s the hardest to see because it’s not words, it’s action.&nbsp; It’s not posted on a board, it’s everywhere.&nbsp; And by everywhere, I mean it’s not just inside or outside a building on a given day at a given time, it’s people going out into the world and actually doing what those other signs say.</p>
<p>We have a place to gather so that we can take what we share there out into the world.&nbsp; We have words to teach and inspire so that love and grace and wonder won’t just sit in a pew, but live in people’s lives and be shared with everyone.&nbsp; Look.&nbsp; The signs are all around you.</p>
