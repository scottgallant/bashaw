<p>True story.&nbsp; I had to rescue Jesus from the side of the highway last Sunday morning.&nbsp; His car broke down.&nbsp; On the way to church.</p>
<p>I was the closest, so I had to go back and get him.&nbsp; Church just wouldn’t have been the same that morning without Jesus.</p>
<p>Jesus was travelling alone.&nbsp; And he was behind me, so he was a little late, probably doing something, I guess.&nbsp; You know Jesus, right?</p>
<p>I should have messaged him and asked if he needed a ride in the first place.&nbsp; His vehicle hasn’t been all that reliable lately.&nbsp; This wasn’t the first time it had broken down and left him in the lurch.&nbsp; I should have offered to take him, but I didn’t.</p>
<p>But there were others who could have taken him, too.&nbsp; Yeah, so it’s not just me that didn’t think of him.&nbsp; Or maybe they did and he just wanted some alone time.&nbsp; Doesn’t matter.&nbsp; For whatever reason, there was one, so I don’t feel bad about it.</p>
<p>Besides, I’m pretty busy, too.&nbsp; That’s why I was still the closest.&nbsp; Everyone else was already at the church or almost there and I was still on my way.&nbsp; If I hadn’t been, it would have been even further to go to get him.&nbsp; If we even did.&nbsp; We probably would’ve been fine without him, but still, good thing I was handy.</p>
<p>When I came for him, Jesus was grateful for the hand.&nbsp; You could tell he was pretty disappointed in his vehicle, though.&nbsp; He’d picked it because he thought it was reliable and he could trust it.&nbsp; He said it’d been around for a while, but hadn’t been used much.</p>
<p>It was a little ways further back than I thought, so we got to the church late.&nbsp; They started without us.&nbsp; Thankfully, the leader there didn’t give up on us and got people started so they’d be ready.&nbsp; Because, of course, it did matter that Jesus was there.&nbsp; It made a difference to everyone who was there who heard and sang and laughed and clapped and left inspired to share some Jesus in the world.</p>
<p>That is, as I said, a true story.</p>
<p>Last Sunday, the cast of Godspell was participating in the morning service in Camrose, where they were performing that weekend.&nbsp; Their minister had crafted the service around that.&nbsp; The actor who plays Jesus did get stuck on the highway, I was the closest person, I did go back for him and we were late.&nbsp; And we, all of us who were there, were part of something special that everyone took away with them.</p>
<p>I also said that I was going to be telling this story.&nbsp; Not just because it happened, but because it’s true.&nbsp; The metaphors abound.</p>
<p>Jesus calls us into a relationship.&nbsp; We may rely on Jesus, hear the stories of Jesus and speak to the importance of Jesus in our lives, but the way isn’t followed sitting down.&nbsp; We, as the song says, are the hands and feet of Jesus now.&nbsp; And, while I suspect most people wouldn’t admit it, it can be easier to leave Jesus stranded on the road than we think.&nbsp; Please, be the hands and feet of Jesus as much as the mouth.&nbsp; Move, as much as meditate; participate, as much as ponder &nbsp; Be Mary as well as Martha.&nbsp; Because that story’s not really about which way is better, period.&nbsp; It’s about knowing when which way is better.&nbsp; Life is about both.</p>
<p>The church hasn’t always been the most reliable vehicle for Jesus, has it?&nbsp; It’s been around for awhile and it could use a tuneup.&nbsp; So could you.&nbsp; Be ready.&nbsp; Be Jesus.</p>
