<p>Went out the door just the other day and there it was.&nbsp; It shouldn’t have been, but it was.&nbsp; It was too soon.&nbsp; The end of February?&nbsp; No, this is Alberta.</p>
<p>But it was unmistakable: the dank, musty smell of wet earth.&nbsp; Some people may not think it’s the most pleasant smell, but it’s the smell of spring.&nbsp; The stench of life.</p>
<p>Oh sure, there’s still time for winter to make a resurgence.&nbsp; It was even colder again the next day.&nbsp; But you’ve smelled it, too, haven’t you?</p>
<p>Does it surprise you?&nbsp; Catch you off guard?&nbsp; It’s a little early.&nbsp; Remember last year?&nbsp; Well, last year wasn’t too bad, but remember the year before?&nbsp; Brrr.</p>
<p>Doesn’t matter, now, though, because it’s there.&nbsp; To me, it’s the smell of spring.&nbsp; And that means the seemingly dead earth is coming back to life again.&nbsp; Breathe it in.&nbsp; Savour it.&nbsp; What does it mean to you?</p>
<p>The Gospel of John tells a story of Jesus stopping for dinner at Lazarus’ house before entering Jerusalem for the last time.&nbsp; That’s the Lazarus that Jesus had earlier raised from the dead, by the way.&nbsp; At the dinner, Lazarus’ sister Mary takes a container of nard, a very expensive perfumed oil, and anoints Jesus’ feet with it.&nbsp; And “the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume” (John 12:3).</p>
<p>Judas challenges the waste of something so expensive that could have been sold to help the poor.&nbsp; But Jesus says “leave her alone.&nbsp; She bought it so that she might keep it for the day of my burial.&nbsp; You always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me” (John 12:7-8).</p>
<p>Think about the imagery here for a minute.&nbsp; Mary anoints his feet, but this is more than the hospitable act of washing his feet.&nbsp; Jesus suggests that she had bought the nard for his burial.&nbsp; So is Mary foreshadowing his death?&nbsp; The Temple authorities have already decided to kill Jesus.&nbsp; But Jesus wasn’t the only “dead man walking” at supper.&nbsp; According to this passage from John, they also plan to kill Lazarus because of all the attention he’s getting (John 12:10-11).&nbsp; After all, Jesus had raised him from the dead and he was attracting a crowd.&nbsp; This meal was like a very public last supper.</p>
<p>And “the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.”</p>
<p>Good thing, don’t you think.&nbsp; In the story of Lazarus, his family is reluctant to open the tomb because “Lord, already there is a stench because he has been dead four days” (John 11:39).&nbsp; Was Lazarus free of the stench of death when he was raised to life?&nbsp; Maybe.&nbsp; But people came to see him because he had been dead.&nbsp; Dead.&nbsp; Now he wasn’t.</p>
<p>And here’s Jesus, surrounded by friends and followers, very much alive, radiantly smelling of an expensive perfume, a perfume he says is for his burial.&nbsp; But it’s Jesus who says that and Mary isn’t keeping it for his burial, she’s using it now.&nbsp; In front of everyone.</p>
<p>Perhaps instead of giving it to death, Mary decided to give it to life.&nbsp; Mary honours Jesus with an outrageous act of gratitude for the life Jesus gave back to Lazarus, gave back to all of them.</p>
<p>That smell in the air?&nbsp; It’s the sweet scent of new life.</p>
