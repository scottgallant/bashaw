<p>What’s next?</p>
<p>I don’t know.&nbsp; Truly, I don’t know the answer to that question, not exactly.&nbsp; And neither do you.&nbsp; Not exactly.&nbsp; Because what’s next hasn’t happened yet.&nbsp; That’s why it’s called “next.”</p>
<p>I’m not trying to be flippant, just precise.&nbsp; We can, sometimes, predict what’s going to happen in a general way.&nbsp; We may even feel the confidence of knowing that things seemed to have happened they way we thought they would, good or bad.&nbsp; But the fact is, given the universe full of variables in each and every moment of time as we experience it, things never happen exactly as we predicted, do they?&nbsp; Because the moment, in the linear way in which we perceive time, hasn’t happened yet.</p>
<p>That’s not to say we don’t try to make things happen a certain way, of course we do.&nbsp; That’s how we go forward on our life journey.&nbsp; Simply put, we “do.”&nbsp; And sometimes we embrace the journey forward with joy and sometimes we fear it.&nbsp; Sometimes, maybe a little of both.&nbsp; But one of those things is life-giving and the other isn’t.</p>
<p>I’m pondering that this week while I sit in a meeting of the local region of my church.&nbsp; We’re discussing - and voting on - the steps our national church is taking to restructure and re-energize this institution we call the church.&nbsp; There’s a lot of anxiety.&nbsp; People are worried about the future.</p>
<p>You’ll know the feeling.&nbsp; Maybe not about the church, but you’ll know the feeling.&nbsp; Who hasn’t, at some point, worried about what was going to happen next?&nbsp; And especially if you fear that something that’s important to you, something or someone you love, something that you’ve been a part of, is threatened or might come to an end, you know this feeling.</p>
<p>Well that’s the scene in John’s gospel when the disciples are all gathered around Jesus for the Passover meal that last night before he died.&nbsp; It begins in John 13:1 with “Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart from this world.”&nbsp; It includes that moment Jesus washes the disciples feet to show them how important it is to serve others:&nbsp;“for I have set you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you.&nbsp; Very truly, I tell you, servants are not greater than their master, nor are messengers greater than the one who sent them.”&nbsp;&nbsp;It includes that last supper Jesus shared with a diverse group of disciples, with both Judas, his betrayer, and Peter, the one who promises to follow, but who will soon deny knowing him.</p>
<p>It includes that moment I talked about last week when Jesus challenges the disciples to love one another just as he has shown them to do.&nbsp; Those aren’t words of comfort, they’re a call to action.&nbsp; This is how you follow me, he says.&nbsp; And I think Jesus knew exactly how hard that was going to be for them to do and how hard the world was going to make it for them to do.&nbsp; And the same goes for us.&nbsp; Like I said before, let’s acknowledge that’s hard and that we fail often but we are always and forever called to try.</p>
<p>And if Jesus had left it right there, we - and the disciples - might be tempted to say “gosh, thanks Jesus for dropping that on us and leaving.”&nbsp; But Jesus doesn’t.</p>
<p>There are words of comfort and inspiration and a promise of support.&nbsp; When I’m gone, Jesus says, the Holy Spirit will come and be with you and will teach you and lead you and remind you of all that I taught you.&nbsp; “Do not let your hearts be troubled, and do not let them be afraid.”</p>
<p>I don’t know what’s next for the church but I believe that we are not alone.&nbsp; We should love each other as Jesus showed us and whatever happens, the Spirit will be with us and we should not be afraid.</p>
<p>I don’t know what’s next for the world or for my little corner of it or for me or you.&nbsp; But whatever happens, I believe that we are not alone.&nbsp; As complex and challenging as life may be, it is only life-giving if it’s lived well.&nbsp; The Spirit will be with us and we should not be afraid.</p>
