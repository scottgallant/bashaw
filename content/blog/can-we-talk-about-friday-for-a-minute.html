+++
<p>Well, this is a little awkward.</p>
<p>I try to post this blog Thursday night and I see it as early reflections on the upcoming Sunday.&nbsp; That’s awkward in Holy Week.&nbsp; It just doesn’t feel right to post thoughts of Easter before saying something about Friday at least.&nbsp; Especially since I mentioned last time how important the story of the whole week is.</p>
<p>But I’ll be honest.&nbsp; I’m not really comfortable talking about Friday.</p>
<p>When I was younger, and a musician, I appreciated the beautiful and moving music and liturgy of the Friday story.&nbsp; I think I still do, as I know many do.&nbsp; But something’s changed for me.&nbsp; Maybe I thought about it too much or wondered about things that just raised questions for me about traditional church thinking.&nbsp; There are a lot more shadows now.Mind if I share some of those shadowy thoughts?&nbsp; It won’t be too in depth (deep, perhaps, but not in depth), just talking points really.</p>
<p>Like “Good” Friday.&nbsp; I don’t know if I can call it “good” anymore.&nbsp; I know, there’s a variety of explanations for the term, like it could be a corruption of “God’s Friday” or that good used to also mean holy (some traditions still call it Holy Friday).&nbsp; But I think most people still understand the “good” part as being that Jesus’ death, while brutal, was required for our redemption from sin.</p>
<p>I have some thoughts about that.</p>
<p>In the gospel narratives, Jesus’ death was not “good” in any way.&nbsp; I’m not sure that I can accept a death as “good” to begin with.&nbsp; I know that “a good death” has become a way of describing the care and compassion, comfort and relief that can be brought to surround someone’s end of life, and I honour that.&nbsp; But there is still loss and grief.&nbsp; It’s not “good,” perhaps, so much as “the best that we can do” and that is, indeed, a wonderful gift.</p>
<p>But in that moment, for all the family, disciples, friends and enemies, even people that had no idea what was going on, Jesus is dead.&nbsp; There is pain and grief.</p>
<p>Jesus died in a horribly brutal way after being physically and mentally abused.&nbsp; It wasn’t “good” in that respect, either, it was suffering.</p>
<p>And just because we know what happens next, I don’t think we get to call it “good” in hindsight, either.&nbsp; Shouldn’t it still be Horrific Friday and Good Easter?</p>
<p>That’s very “in the moment” of the narrative, perhaps, so let’s look at the bigger picture.&nbsp; Jesus died to save us, atonement for our sin, even for our original sin.&nbsp; But, as I’ve said elsewhere at other times, I believe that, created in the image of God, our default setting - our birth setting, if you like - is good.&nbsp; We may choose a different path - to sin - based on our experiences, but we begin from good.&nbsp; From the very beginning.&nbsp; I’ve long wondered if the story of Eve and Adam, the fruit and leaving Eden was really about sin, especially an original one.&nbsp; The original act was choice, the first act of the precious gift of freewill.</p>
<p>There’s been lots of choice since then, both good and bad.&nbsp; And sin.&nbsp; If sin is the thing that drives us further and further away from God, then there’s been a lot.&nbsp; A lot.&nbsp; But not just before Jesus, after Jesus as well.</p>
<p>An act of atonement?&nbsp; I don’t know that I can reconcile a God who requires payment for our sins with a God who’s love is for all, freely and unconditionally given, with grace and forgiveness equally so.&nbsp; I think I go with the latter.</p>
<p>I believe that the life of Jesus is the way to follow: to love as he showed us how to love.&nbsp; I think powerful people, feeling threatened by Jesus’ revolutionary and counter-cultural teaching about love and grace for all, had him killed.&nbsp; They tried to end him without seeing that, as the embodiment of love, as the Word made flesh, you can’t kill that.&nbsp; You’ll only - sorry to sound like Obi-Wan Kenobi - make it “more powerful than you can possibly imagine.”</p>
<p>Jesus brought a world of love, compassion and grace for all.&nbsp; In doing that, he sought to bring us back to God, closer to the source of love and life.&nbsp; We resisted - brutally - and still do.&nbsp; But Jesus continues to live in you and me.&nbsp; Crucifixions of all kinds continue to happen every day and Jesus stands there with us to remind us: this is not the end.&nbsp; There is new life in this world and in the world to come.&nbsp; In the midst of our deepest suffering, our enormous capacity for the harshest cruelty and weakness for the simplest of temptations, Jesus is there to help us shoulder our own crosses.</p>
