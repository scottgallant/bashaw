<p>We tell a story at Christmas.&nbsp; The story we tell is full of angels and shepherds.&nbsp; There's a man and his very pregnant wife who rides on a donkey all the way to tiny Bethlehem.&nbsp; There's a manger full of hay and assorted animals standing around.&nbsp; There's a baby born in the night and three kings who followed a great star to find this baby.&nbsp; Oh, and there's an innkeeper who turns Mary and Joseph away because there's no room, only to then have a change of heart and offer them a stable out back.</p>
<p>Except there isn't.&nbsp; An innkeeper, I mean.&nbsp; There just isn't.</p>
<p>It's the Christmas Story we tell by putting together the accounts of Luke and Matthew.&nbsp; Then we throw in some creative interpretation and maybe even add a detail or two that's not actually in Luke and Matthew and we get the picture perfect scene that makes a Christmas Creche (or nativity set), a beautiful card and a beautiful story.</p>

<p>I don't want to belabour the point that it's the story we tell, not the story that's in the Bible.&nbsp; I think there are valid reasons to tell the story the way we do, just as there are valid reasons to examine more closely what the Bible really says.</p>
<p>Maybe the most important reason for the story we tell might be this: surrounded by the world of today, we need to hear a pastoral story of hope and peace.&nbsp; Perhaps then, we might step out of our crazy, hectic, stressful, hurting and broken world and spend a moment at the manger with a quiet, smiling baby who represents the coming of God's love into the world.&nbsp; After all, the world around the manger that night wasn't really so different.&nbsp; It was hurting and broken, too.&nbsp; And that story we tell is about God doing something different from the world we know.</p>
<p>There's a wonderful Christmas prayer from the Iona Community in Scotland that says "you crept in beside us.&nbsp; And no one knew.&nbsp; Only the few who dared to believe that God might do something different.&nbsp; Will you do the same this Christmas, Jesus?"</p>
<p>That's why we need to imagine the peaceful fields of sheep, even with an angel host above it.&nbsp; Or a cozy stable with a nice warm and comfy manger full of hay.&nbsp; Or the glow of candlelight while we sing "Silent Night" before going out into stillness of a moonlit Christmas Eve.&nbsp; God's love doesn't explode on the world, it creeps in.&nbsp; The moment at the manger is just the beginning.</p>
<p>Oh, and about that innkeeper.&nbsp; There's no innkeeper in Luke.&nbsp; It just says that "there was no place for them in the inn" (Luke 2:7).&nbsp; But, just imagine, whether it was a busy and crowded town or a single overwhelmed innkeeper, it helps us to put a face on that.&nbsp; Because that face could be ours.</p>
<p>Mary and Joseph were guided by angels, messengers from God, who told them what to do and to not be afraid to do it.&nbsp; Same with the shepherds.&nbsp; The magi (the three kings) followed the star, a celestial guide of a prophecy.&nbsp; But the innkeeper and the people in Bethlehem that night, they didn't know who was coming or what was happening.&nbsp; All the innkeeper had to do was answer the door and decide whether to let them in.&nbsp; And a manger was enough.</p>
<p>Find a quiet moment to wonder about the Christmas story and the child in the manger.&nbsp; Will you make room?&nbsp; Not just on Christmas Eve, but each day ahead, will you make room for God's love?</p>
