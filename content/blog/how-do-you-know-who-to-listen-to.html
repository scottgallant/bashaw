<p>It seems a simple enough question.&nbsp; Jesus is approached by a group of people who are clearly not his followers - quite the opposite - and they ask him “look, how long do we have to wait for you to just come out and say it?&nbsp; Are you or are you not the Messiah?”&nbsp; Jesus replies that he has told them, in everything he does and says.&nbsp; They just don’t hear it.&nbsp; And because he’s been telling them that he’s like the gate for the sheepfold and that he’s the Good Shepherd, he says it like this: “you do not belong to my sheep.&nbsp;&nbsp;My sheep hear my voice.&nbsp; I know them, and they follow me” (John 10:26-27).</p>
<p>Um, nope.&nbsp; Still don’t get it.&nbsp; The Good Shepherd might be an endearing image to us, but not them, not in that moment.&nbsp; In fact, Jesus goes on to say that “the Father and I are one” (John 10:30) and they pick up stones and get ready to stone him for blasphemy.&nbsp; But Jesus argues that if he is doing God’s work, they should believe in him.&nbsp; At the very least, they should believe in the things he’s doing as being God’s work and that way, they would come to believe in him as the Messiah.</p>
<p>Um, nope.&nbsp; Still don’t get it.&nbsp; And the author of John says that he escapes before they can arrest him (John 10:39).&nbsp; At least they didn’t stone him, I guess.</p>
<p>The thing is, I think we could be a little more sympathetic to this “just don’t get it” crowd.&nbsp; After all, we’re often in it.</p>
<p>The weeks after Easter are full of stories about doubt and questions.&nbsp; And how many times didn’t people recognize the risen Jesus at first?&nbsp; This story’s a bit of a throw back to the weeks before Jesus’ death, but it still raises that question that everyone wants a clear concise answer for: how do we know you’re who you say you are?&nbsp; How do we know it’s you, Jesus?</p>
<p>Hear my voice, Jesus says.</p>
<p>Right.&nbsp; That’s pretty clear.&nbsp; But the question then is, how do we know which voice is yours, Jesus?&nbsp; There are many voices clamouring to be heard and many of them often appear more appealing.&nbsp; Or familiar or easier or more comfortable.&nbsp; In that regard, things were not much different then, than now.&nbsp; And since then, to be fair, those claiming to be your “official representatives” have not always been the best representation of your voice, either, Jesus.&nbsp; Sometimes quite the opposite, which makes it even harder.&nbsp; So, really, how do we know?</p>
<p>I would never presume to answer for Jesus.&nbsp; But here’s what I think.</p>
<p>I think the very first thing that Jesus would say is “stop clenching that rock so hard.”&nbsp; Just like those questioning Jesus in the story, we listen to react and reply more than to learn and grow.&nbsp; They were ready to stone Jesus, probably even before he finished speaking, because he answered their question and they didn’t like the answer.&nbsp; It was contrary to everything they already knew and were conditioned to believe.&nbsp; It challenged them and disturbed them in ways that moved them to reject it without consideration.</p>
<p>So.&nbsp; Stop clenching that rock so hard, relax and open your heart and mind.&nbsp; Open your eyes to truly see what I’m doing, Jesus might say, and experience what I’m doing.&nbsp; Get to know me better.&nbsp; That’s something you might want to consider doing with everyone you encounter in life.</p>
<p>When you listen to the clamour of all those voices around you, listen for love and grace.&nbsp; Not the perfection of it, just the presence of it is enough to begin.&nbsp; Because love and grace and everything that goes with that - like compassion, care, respect and justice - builds relationships on what is true and that builds real community.&nbsp; Engage those voices, learn and grow from those voices and build relationships with those voices.&nbsp; Learn to reply to hate and anger with love.&nbsp; Reply to selfishness and greed with generosity and sharing, look to serve rather than dominate.&nbsp; That’s what I’ve been showing you, Jesus might say.&nbsp; To know those things is to know me, Jesus might say, and to know me is to know God.</p>
<p>That’s how the sheep know the shepherd and the shepherd knows the sheep.&nbsp; When the relationship is based on love and grace, it’s not just surface behaviour, its a relationship built from the inside out.&nbsp; It’s a relationship built on living what is true.</p>
<p>In this world, that’s a challenge.&nbsp; It’s sometimes easier to build walls or avoid relationships altogether.&nbsp; But that kind of easy and avoidable isn’t life-giving.&nbsp; It’s a challenge and we can fear challenges.&nbsp; Embrace them anyway.&nbsp; If the voice you hear is fear,&nbsp; know that God is with you.&nbsp; We have a relationship, remember?</p>
