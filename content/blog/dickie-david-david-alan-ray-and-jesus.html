<p>Dickie, David, Alan, Ray and Jesus</p>
<p>I hear the word "icon" being used a lot lately.&nbsp; And not in a tech savvy computer user way.</p>
<p>Tech users know an icon's the little thing on your screen that represents what you're going to get when you touch it or click on it.</p>
<p>It's also the proper name for a venerated painting or pictorial representation of a saint or religious figure, particularly in the Orthodox and Eastern Christian churches.</p>
<p>But the origin of "icon" is in the Greek, meaning a likeness or an image.&nbsp; Our contemporary use is to mean a person or thing that represents something meaningful to us.</p>
<p>So that's how it came up when I ran into somebody at the gas station just after David Bowie died.&nbsp; We talked about him being an icon, not just for his creative musical artistry, but for being faithful to being himself.&nbsp; He inspired artists and musicians and anyone who was unique and different to be true to who they are and to believe in their imagination and creativity.&nbsp; Sadly, we also noted, icons, just like everyone, leave us.&nbsp; What we have is their image, indelibly printed on us.</p>
<p>That's undoubtedly why we've been hearing it so much lately.&nbsp; We've lost some pretty important icons in the last little while, like&nbsp; Dickie Moore, David Bowie, Alan Rickman and Ray Daley.</p>
<p>There's lots more, to be sure, but the point is that we acknowledge their iconic nature based on what they represent to us, personally.&nbsp; That can then become collectively recognized, depending on their fame or their appeal, and to whom they appeal and how.</p>
<p>Dickie Moore, for example, was a legendary hockey player with the Montreal Canadiens, a Hall of Famer who, with Jean Beliveau and the Richard brothers, led the Canadiens to six Stanley Cups in the late 1950's.&nbsp; He was a gifted player and a determined competitor.</p>
<p>David Bowie was an amazing musician and an innovative artist who challenged norms in music, art, gender and spirituality, inspiring other to do the same.</p>
<p>Alan Rickman was an actor who's distinctive voice and style took him from Shakespeare to Harry Potter in a wide variety of roles, creating "iconic" characters.&nbsp; He was also known to be generous and supportive of other actors and is remembered by colleagues and critics as one of the greatest actors of his generation.</p>
<p>Ray Daley was a good man.&nbsp; He'd probably be embarrassed to be included here, although I'm pretty sure he'd be shocked to be mentioned with David Bowie (and not in a good way).&nbsp; You might not have included him, either, because you might not know who he is.</p>
<p>Ray died just before Christmas after a long and stubborn battle with cancer.&nbsp; Ray was a little bit rough around the edges and he certainly had his struggles in life.&nbsp; I only got to know Ray in the last six years, but to me he's an icon.&nbsp; He loved his family, the Royal Canadian Legion and his church.&nbsp; He was one of the best "not-a-church-goer-s" I ever met.&nbsp; He didn't care much for sitting in a pew, but he was, as he said, a "believer" who would rather be doing something than sitting, listening to someone talk about it.</p>
<p>At his memorial at the Legion, there were stories from others of how Ray touched their lives in ways they'll always remember, always live out.&nbsp; Of course, Ray wasn't famous, not beyond his community, but then, he wasn't trying to be.&nbsp; He was just trying to be Ray to one person at a time.</p>
<p>This time of year is the season of Epiphany, the season of "revealing" when we hear stories of Jesus being, well, Jesus.&nbsp; There was no PR campaign or global broadcast.&nbsp; The angels came to a few poor shepherds.&nbsp; It was a few magi who followed the star.&nbsp; When Mary and Joseph took Jesus to the temple to be named, it was only Simeon and Anna that knew him.&nbsp; How big, really, was the crowd who saw John - one on one - baptize Jesus.&nbsp; At the wedding in Cana, who knew Jesus had turned the water into wine?&nbsp; Only a few.&nbsp; And when Jesus proclaims "the Spirit of the Lord is upon me" in the synagogue, it was to a small, hometown crowd who knew him. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think fame was on Jesus' agenda.&nbsp; I think he was more concerned with personal, heart felt contact, with being Jesus to one person at a time, bringing love and compassion to one person at a time, bringing people closer to God one person at a time.&nbsp; Jesus' fame grew as those who experienced him shared their stories and their lives, living as Jesus showed them, one person at a time.</p>
<p>It's so easy for our eyes to be drawn to the famous and perhaps they are, sometimes, deserving.&nbsp; But look at the people around you: I bet there's an icon of Jesus there.&nbsp; And look at you: can you, too, be an icon of Jesus to those around you?&nbsp; Maybe even one person at a time.</p>
