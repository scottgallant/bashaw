<p>The other day, I was having a conversation with a young person, much younger, cooler and more hip than me, and he punctuated something he was saying with “d’ya feel me?”&nbsp; I paused for a moment and said “did you just ask me if I ‘feel’ you?”</p>
<p>He looked puzzled and said that, yes, he did.&nbsp; “You know, like ‘do you get me’ or ‘do you know what I mean?’&nbsp; When I looked skeptical, he said “hey, it’s what everybody says now.”&nbsp; I said “I don’t,” probably a little too self-consciously, but then wondered, once again, how quickly one gets old and out of date.</p>
<p>It’s understandable, though, using our senses to put a physical framework on something that isn’t so physical: understanding.&nbsp; We do it all the time.&nbsp; How often have you said “I see” to acknowledge that you understand something?&nbsp; Or “I hear you” as a way of indicating you heard more than the words, you know what the person means?&nbsp; Or how about you can handle it or you can grasp the concept?&nbsp; We even say that we’re so close to something, “we can taste it” and wonder that this deal “smells fishy.”&nbsp; Not to mention that we can “smell what the Rock is cookin’.”</p>
<p>“I was blind, but now I see,” John Newton famously wrote in Amazing Grace.&nbsp; It’s a tremendous and inspiring story, how Newton had been a slave ship captain but “saw the light” and became a priest, an abolitionist and an ally of William Wilberforce, the British politician who led the movement to abolish the slave trade.&nbsp; Ironically, Newton went physically blind, but was spiritually enlightened.</p>
<p>Saul saw the light, too.&nbsp; Not the ancient king, but the devout Jew who pursued the earliest followers of Jesus in the years after the first Pentecost - they were called people of The Way, then.&nbsp; He approved the stoning of Stephen and tried to destroy the new church (Acts 8:1-3).&nbsp; He was on his way to Damascus to arrest more and “bring them bound to Jerusalem” (Acts 9:2) when it happened to him.&nbsp; There was a flash of light that knocked him down (literally) and the voice of Jesus speaks to him, telling him to go into the city and he’ll be told what to do.&nbsp; Saul is blinded for three days until a disciple named Ananias, told by God to visit him, comes to him and says “Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on your way here, has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit” (Acts 9:17).&nbsp; His sight returns and he’s a changed man.&nbsp; He later adopts the name Paul and becomes the great builder of the earliest church communities.</p>
<p>The thing is, we often portray these “see the light” moments as just that, a moment.&nbsp; A sudden flash, a light bulb goes on and everything’s changed.</p>
<p>If only it were that simple.</p>
<p>John Newton marks a moment in which he called out to God during a storm at sea in March of 1748 as the beginning of his spiritual conversion.&nbsp; He continued working in the slave trade until a stroke forced him to retire in 1754, though he continued to invest in it for a few more years.&nbsp; He became a priest in 1764.&nbsp; Amazing Grace (and other hymns) appeared in 1779.&nbsp; It wasn’t until 1788 that he began to speak forcefully against the slave trade and he lived to see the Abolition Act passed in 1807, dying shortly afterwards.&nbsp; He would acknowledge, late in life, that it took him many years from that moment at sea to find his way.</p>
<p>Saul’s moment was a beginning, too, and not just three days of blindness.&nbsp; I think it took him a while to really get into that conversion moment.&nbsp; He needed to learn things, he needed to experience things, he needed to find his way from being a good Jew to a good Christian.&nbsp; He needed to understand what was happening.&nbsp; And that was a challenge at first because the very community he wanted to join was afraid of him: they didn’t believe that he had changed (Acts 9:21-30).&nbsp; It took some time.</p>
<p>Conversions begin with a change - a change of heart - but they take work to live into the change.&nbsp; And that’s where the senses make sense of things, as it were.&nbsp; We begin to see more clearly and hear more deeply, we learn and experience, we taste life and we live it with all our senses.&nbsp; That’s what leads us to what is true.</p>
<p>It takes time and, of course, that means uniquely our own time.&nbsp; Finding love, grace, respect, compassion, truth - these aren’t new things.&nbsp; They’re already in you.&nbsp; And me and everyone else.&nbsp; This isn’t about religion or tradition or culture, it’s about finding what’s true in each of us and following that path.&nbsp; We are each unique individuals, but we are one in being created in the image of God and God is love.</p>
<p>These conversion experiences don’t make something new out of nothing.&nbsp; They make something truly you out of everything you are.</p>
<p>D'ya feel me?</p>
