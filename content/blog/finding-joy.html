<p>Shrek's been in the house the last few weeks.&nbsp; Our church in Bashaw has hosted nine performances (and all the costumes, sets and rehearsals) of Shrek: The Musical.&nbsp; And it was awesome.&nbsp; "Really, really," as Donkey says.</p>
<p>After the final show, one of the audience came up to me and said "are you the pastor of this church?"&nbsp; I said yes and he said "well that was just wonderful.&nbsp; I think it's great that you allow this here."</p>
<p>Not the first time I've heard that comment and I'm still so surprised to hear it that I don't really know what to say.&nbsp; I said "thanks."</p>
<p>The thought never crosses my mind that we "allow it."&nbsp; I think we treasure it.</p>
<p>I should mention, if I haven't before, that Bashaw Community Theatre stages its performances in the church itself, not in the hall.&nbsp; The swamp and castle for Shrek cover the cross (and most of the front of the church).&nbsp; Just as the sets did for all the previous plays.&nbsp; So I can see why some people might think that there's an issue of appropriateness.</p>
<p>Not to mention content, right?&nbsp; Shrek's full of ogres and fairytale characters and, well, there's that burp and fart competition that Shrek and Fiona have.&nbsp; Oh, and Pinocchio says "crap" and Little Red Riding Hood says the swamp "smells like butt."&nbsp; But I'm pretty sure I've talked about this kind of thing before.&nbsp; This isn't our first play with farting.&nbsp; Or fairytale characters, or fighting, running, yelling or anything else that people might think is inappropriate to a sacred space.&nbsp; Don't even start me on the symbols of ancient Egyptian religions in Aida or the man-eating plant in Little Shop of Horrors.</p>
<p>Yes, I can see why there may be some questions and we've had them, too.&nbsp; There has even been times that we changed a thing or two.&nbsp; What's always been important to us, I hope, has been that we are true to our understanding of what makes a space sacred.</p>
<p>And that has been on my mind this week, because the third Sunday of Advent is joy and I think that is a big part of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be easy to point to the enjoyment of everyone in the audience, it's really good entertainment.&nbsp; How do you value the smiling and wondering faces of children and adults enthralled with Shrek, Donkey and Fiona only a few steps away from them or the fun the cast and crew have in putting it all together?&nbsp; There's a lot of happiness to go around.</p>
<p>But, more than that, there's a deeper and more profound joy.&nbsp;A place is not made sacred because we say so or because we put a label on it, it's made sacred by the spirit of those who gather there to create a community in which everyone's gifts are acknowledged, encouraged and embraced.&nbsp; It's made sacred by the sharing of struggle and success, the moments of achievement and fulfillment, the lifting of spirits, the warmth of relationships and yes, even the happiness.&nbsp; When people feel welcome, appreciated and safe, then amazing things happen.</p>
<p>You might enjoy a great show, you might feel touched by the ideas and themes or even the performance itself.&nbsp; One person at Shrek said that it's so great to see something that's so much fun for kids, but has such a great message about how we judge others and about knowing who we really are.&nbsp; But there's more: there's a sense of family.&nbsp; For cast and crew, it comes from all those hours together, from all the hard work, the learning and growing and, most importantly, the relationships we build.&nbsp; That's the deeper joy of knowing a place where you belong because you're you.&nbsp; That's a place where love is shared.</p>
<p>We call it community theatre, but I'd hope that might be how we'd talk about church, too.&nbsp; And, yes, I know that not all churches are like that, nor are all groups that call themselves "a community."&nbsp; I also know that the ideal that we call a "family" can struggle as well.</p>
<p>But, listen, here is good news: the joy of Christmas is that very thing.&nbsp; It isn't about the stuff that will make us happy for a moment, but the moment that will stick with your heart through happiness and grief, struggle and success, comfort and conflict.&nbsp; In that moment will be love, shared.</p>
<p>That's what makes the family or community.&nbsp; Or church.&nbsp; That's what brings true joy, that love is present and we belong in it.</p>
<p>In the darkest moment, light came.&nbsp;In the meanest moment, love came.&nbsp;In the quietest moment, the Word was spoken into life.And in the loneliest moment, we found belonging.</p>
