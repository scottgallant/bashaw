<p>As a church community believe in living God’s love and sharing God’s love.  In fact, it’s written right into our Vision Statement, and we really do mean it.  And that’s why we’re doing big things in the Bashaw community, 7 days a week!  Please consider making a donation today, to support the work we do in the community today, tomorrow, and every day.</p>
