Did you know the Bashaw United Church places monthly orders through FundScrip to help raise money for our church? Consider taking part! It is a very simple process that can aid in your personal budgeting while also helping your church to raise money!


HOW DOES IT WORK?


Step 1: Buy cards at face value, get face value at retailers - you lose nothing.


Step 2: Shop as usual! With gift cards from over 190 leading retailers, you can visit your regular stores, and just make sure to pay with your new gift cards!


Step 3: Generate earnings for the church! With each gift card you purchase, the church earns a percentage from FundScrip which supports the church's amazing work in our community.


HOW DO I GET INVOLVED?


Every 1st Sunday of the month is a FundScrip Sunday (that just means order forms are due). You can stop by the church during office hours to pick up an order form, or visit the link below for an excel version of the order form. You can download the excel doc, fill it out with your order, and hand it in via e-mail. Just make sure to drop your cheque off at the church before FundScrip Sunday! Then we will place your order for you, and your gift cards should arrive by the following Sunday. It's that easy! AND you get to support the work of the Bashaw United Church in the process. Win/win. If you have any questions about FundScrip or the process of ordering, stop by the church during office hours, give us a call, or send us an email!
