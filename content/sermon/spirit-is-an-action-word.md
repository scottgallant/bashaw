description = "\"The hills are alive with the Sound of Music.\" (Psst. That's really the Spirit singing.) The Spirit's in the hills, the valleys, the plains - the Spirit is like the wind and blows where it will, says Jesus. It blows through the church, too, and you can catch some of it by taking a look at this sermon."
