<p>Children are an important part of our congregation!!</p>
<p>On sunday mornings, we gather as the Whole People of God.  Our opening prayers, hymns and songs reflect the diversity of our ages and backgrounds - that "we who are many and come from many places" have gathered as a community.  There is time for a story or activity that introduces the theme and key scripture passage for the day.  We call this time Learning Together because it is not just time for the children, but for the whole congregation to learn and experience God.</p>
<p>After a song or hymn, the children go downstairs or outside.  They’ll hear the same scripture story the adults will and engage it in prayer and discussion with a creative activity that connects to the theme of the day.  Art, drama, song and play are all part of the morning.</p>
<p>The children also occasionally lead the Sunday morning service for everyone, present an annual Christmas pageant or drama and have after school events, like Messy Church.  Our Movie Night series includes a Family Movie each month.</p>
<p>Our week-long summer program for children usually runs in the third week of July each year.</p>
