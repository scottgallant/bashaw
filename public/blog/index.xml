      <description>&lt;p&gt;When did we get to be so afraid?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anxiety, worry, a lack of confidence in ourselves or the world around us, many - and real - are our fears.  It doesn&#39;t help that we&#39;re still in the longest election campaign since 1872.  If it&#39;s not the outrageous promises, it&#39;s all the things that you should be afraid of and what will happen if - insert person or party here - gets elected.  And it&#39;ll be another year of that for our friends to the south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it&#39;s Thanksgiving this week, the day of, well, giving thanks.  How do you do that when there&#39;s so much fear and anxiety in the world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s lots of people who will struggle to find something to be thankful for this weekend.  And some who won&#39;t succeed.  There&#39;s a great many people who will sit around the great Thanksgiving feast and find that things to be thankful for come more readily to mind.  When they think about them.  But they have to try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, sure, there may be some people who find it easy to be thankful because gratitude comes easily to them.  They aren&#39;t as anxious and fearful, but readily embrace the world as it comes, looking for the goodness they know is in all life.  I know these people exist because I live with one.  It&#39;s a gift that not many have.  Thank goodness they share it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Jesus knows that so many of us are afraid.  &#34;Don&#39;t be afraid&#34; is one of the most common themes in Jesus ministry.  In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus has some words during the famous Sermon on the Mount for those who struggle with fear and anxiety, worry and confidence.  He says, &#34;don&#39;t worry about your life … look at the birds of the air … consider the lilies, how they grow&#34; (Matt. 6:25-29).  If God takes care of such as these, then God will take care of you, too.  Life is about so much more than just stuff, he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great.  That&#39;s very comforting.  And we&#39;ve often heard that as simply &#34;don&#39;t worry, be happy&#34; (thank you Bobby McFerrin) or &#34;don&#39;t worry, God will take care of you.  You don&#39;t have to do anything.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, yes, we do.  We need to choose.  All of this &#34;don&#39;t worry&#34; business comes after this one key statement: you can&#39;t have two masters.  You must choose which will govern your life, God or stuff (Matt. 6:24).  Wealth, riches, money, the King James bible calls it mammon, the desire for material things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t think that Jesus is saying that having wealth, money or things is inherently bad.  But when we let those material things rule our lives, we value all things in that context and our lives become an endless quest to meet a need for more stuff that we can never achieve.  We begin to see life in the context of what we don&#39;t have, rather than what we do, what we want, rather than need, and what we fear losing, rather than what we&#39;re willing to share.  The fear of scarcity overwhelms the joy of abundance and we seek to acquire more and protect what we have.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/dalai-lama.png&#34; alt=&#34;The more you are motivated by love, the more fearless and free your actions will be. - Dalai Lama&#34; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But what happens when we choose God?  We choose love.  We value our selves more than our stuff, and love our neighbour as we love ourselves.  We choose compassion and care and we share that with others.  And when we all share love, we create a world in which all that we need is shared.  We feed and care for each other, we nurture confidence and we encourage and inspire creativity and, most important of all, we are not afraid to engage others in a relationship based in that love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that all sounds very idyllic or utopian, a perfectness that we might think is beyond us.  But I bet Jesus would say &#34;don&#39;t worry.  That love is already in you.  Stuff is not.  Share that love that&#39;s in you.  Don&#39;t be afraid.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Are You Able?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/Are-You-Able/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I feel sorry for the disciples, at least in their early apprentice years with Jesus.  They get pretty solid, post resurrection, but early on they seem to be pretty dense.  They play the ordinary, everyday guy-off-the-street (or boat) really well, but sometimes, when they repeatedly just don&#39;t seem to get it, I wonder if Jesus might not have assembled a better crew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I remind myself that Jesus picked them for a reason.  They&#39;re just like me.  Or you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gospel of Mark is particularly hard on the disciples.  There&#39;s one stretch, a cycle of three little episodes, in which Jesus tries to teach them about what it really means to be the messiah and what&#39;s ahead for Jesus (arrest, death and resurrection) and each time, they respond in a way that seems to indicate they just don&#39;t understand.  Peter, for example, correctly labels Jesus the messiah, but he tries to chastise Jesus when Jesus tries to explain what that really means.  Then the disciples argue amongst themselves who is the greatest.  And then there&#39;s James and John.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poor James and John.  They&#39;re the ones who ask Jesus if they could &#34;sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory&#34; (Mark 10:37).  In other words, when all the bad stuff&#39;s done and we&#39;ve won, could we have a place of honour, please?  They still seem to think this is about power over others, being appropriately rewarded for their devotion and a place in the hierarchy of greatness.  They&#39;ve been with Jesus for awhile now and they&#39;re on their way to Jerusalem next, you&#39;d think they&#39;d be catching on.  You can just imagine Jesus doing a facepalm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said, though, just like me or you.  The disciples had a few years with Jesus.  We&#39;ve had a couple of thousand and we still think being a leader is about power over others, we still reward loyalty the same way and we haven&#39;t really changed our hierarchy of greatness, have we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s the thing, though.  Who doesn&#39;t want to be near Jesus?  Sure, they&#39;re looking for a special place, but maybe we could cut them a little slack for wanting to be near Jesus when it gets to the good part (the &#34;glory&#34;) after all that other hard stuff he was talking about is done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d like to be near Jesus.  So here&#39;s something instructive about the story.  &#34;But Jesus said to them, &#39;You do not know what you are asking.  Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?&#39;  They replied, &#39;We are able&#39;&#34; (Mark 10:38-39).  And yes, they are.  They are able to be like Jesus.  They&#39;re the first Jesus&#39; apprentices after all.  But, Jesus says, he doesn&#39;t have the authority to decide about who ends up where &#34;in glory.&#34;  Perhaps that&#39;s Jesus being like us, a reminder that it&#39;s God that decides that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is that we can be &#34;like&#34; Jesus.  Perhaps we won&#39;t achieve what Jesus does, but that&#39;s not the point.  Just as we&#39;re created in the image of God, says Genesis, but we are not God.  What we are is able.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I once was blind but now I see</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/bartimaeus/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2&gt;Bartimaeus gets a name.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you&#39;re familiar with the story of Jesus healing a blind beggar who&#39;s name is Bartimaeus (Mark 10:46-52), that might not seem like a big deal, but I think it is.  Many bible scholars have researched it and there&#39;s some fascinating theories about his name and what it means.  They&#39;re very interesting, but I just think it&#39;s important he got a name.  Any name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus heals a lot of people and nobody gets a name except Bartimaeus.  Well, there&#39;s Lazarus, I guess, but that&#39;s more a resurrection than a healing.  And people seemed to know Lazarus.  He even gets a second mention and the people&#39;s awareness of Lazarus seems to have made the Temple authorities nervous: &#34;so the chief priests planned to put Lazarus to death as well, since it was on account of him that many of the Jews were deserting and were believing in Jesus&#34; (John 12:9-11).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if that isn&#39;t why Bartimaeus gets a name.  Maybe the author of Mark thought people would recognize him, hearing this as an origin story for a figure they knew.  Maybe they knew Bartimaeus for more than this story, because of this story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Mark&#39;s narrative, we&#39;ve just seen three episodes in which Jesus tries to explain to the disciples what he&#39;s all about and they just don&#39;t seem to understand.  Peter earlier correctly identifies him as the messiah, but then doesn&#39;t seem to understand what that means: Jesus is not the kind of messiah they were expecting.  Or that anyone was expecting.  They just don&#39;t see what he means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there&#39;s this blind beggar at Jericho.  He seems to know who Jesus is, calling out to him &#34;Son of David,&#34; another name for the Messiah.  The son of Timaeus (that&#39;s what Bar-Timaeus means) calls to the Son of David.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does he know who Jesus is?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the same way we all know what&#39;s true: both by knowing it intuitively and by what we&#39;ve experienced.  This little story begins with &#34;they came to Jericho&#34; and the very next thing is &#34;as they were leaving Jericho,&#34; there&#39;s Bartimaeus.  What happened in Jericho?  Maybe Bartimaeus heard Jesus doing what Jesus does, teaching and healing, and put that together with his own sense of what was true and realized who it was.  We can all do that with what&#39;s true, can&#39;t we?  What we know and what we experience?  Maybe Bartimaeus is really good at discerning truth, but, still, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s why he gets a name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&#39;s persistent, too, with his calling to Jesus, even when others try to silence him.  And when he finally has Jesus&#39; attention, he leaves behind his cloak, probably his one possession of any value, and comes to Jesus, asking only for his sight to be restored.  &#34;Go,&#34; says Jesus, &#34;your faith has made you well.&#34;  That is a powerful faith, but, still, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what makes him name-worthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#34;Immediately he regained his sight and followed him on the way&#34; (Mark 10:52).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait.  What?  Jesus told him to go, but he didn&#39;t.  Instead, he &#34;followed him on the way.&#34;  I think people might have known Bartimaeus, not by who he had been, not by what happened here with Jesus, but what happened next: &#34;he regained his sight and followed him on the way.&#34;  Isn&#39;t that the lesson of this story for us?  Not just that he believed, but that he followed on the way.  With his physical sight restored, he lived into the what his heart saw to be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2009 film Amazing Grace is about the campaign to end slavery in the late 18th century.  The title refers to the supportive influence of John Newton, a former slave ship captain and author of the famous hymn, on William Wilberforce, the key figure in the campaign.  In one scene, Wilberforce visits the aging Newton, now physically blind.  Newton has written down all the ships, routes and slave traders he recalls and offers it to Wilberforce as evidence to help the cause.  He quotes his hymn, &#34;&#39;I once was blind but now I see.&#39;  Didn&#39;t I write that, too?&#34;  Wilberforce replies &#34;yes, you did.&#34;  &#34;Well, now at last it&#39;s true,&#34; says Newton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It became true not just in faith, but living that faith into action.  I think that&#39;s how we should know Bartimaeus.  It should be how we know each other, too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
